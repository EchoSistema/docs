# ComplaintBook

ComplaintBook is a platform for managing complaints, mediating solutions with feedback and rating.

Each platform must include the `X-PUBLIC-KEY` header to authenticate and receive responses. The frontend should send the current application language via the `Accept-Language` header (e.g., `en`, `pt-BR`).
