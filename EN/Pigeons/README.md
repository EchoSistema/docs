# Pigeons

Pigeons is a platform for contacts, emails, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, inbound marketing, outbound marketing, and general messaging.

Each platform must include the `X-PUBLIC-KEY` header to authenticate and receive responses. The frontend should send the current application language via the `Accept-Language` header (e.g., `en`, `pt-BR`).
