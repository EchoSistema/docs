User biography and professional profile management.

The Bio domain provides comprehensive APIs for managing user professional profiles, including biographical information, work experience, education, certifications, skills, publications, portfolios, and more.

All endpoints require authentication via `Bearer {token}` with the `backoffice` ability and `domain:bio` permission, except where noted otherwise.
