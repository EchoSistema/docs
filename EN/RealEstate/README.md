# RealEstate

RealEstate centralizes listings, agents, rental fairs, and platform assets used by the EchoSistema real-estate experience. The APIs expose resources for browsing residential and commercial properties, retrieving platform-specific media, and cataloging property, rent, and agent metadata for backoffice and storefronts.
